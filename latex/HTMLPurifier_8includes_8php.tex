\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
You must {\itshape not} include any other H\+T\+M\+L \hyperlink{classPurifier}{Purifier} files before this file, because 'require' not 'require\+\_\+once' is used.

This file requires that the include path contains the H\+T\+M\+L \hyperlink{classPurifier}{Purifier} library directory; this is not auto-\/set.
